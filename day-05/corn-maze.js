/*
You have a corn maze. Give me a problem that will tell you how to walk from the start to the end in the quickest possible time.
You are given the start and end point.
Best possible route? Are there any weighted costs we should be aware of?
  Path that takes the shortest amount of time or path.
What might the maze look like?
  It would be a graph.
  Represented as a coordinate-system graph... the nodes are the cells, and all nodes have connections (up, down, left, right). walls prevent an edge between nodes on either side.

--- breadth first search.
  can use a matrix or a list however you want.
  -- give the path.
